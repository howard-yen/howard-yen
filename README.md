### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Howard Yen, a senior studying Computer Science at Princeton University. 

Here's a little bit about me: 
- Iâ€™m currently taking the classes: Systems and Machine Learning, Neural Networks: Theory and Applications.
- I'm currently part of the Princeton NLP Group, advised by Danqi Chen and mentored by Tianyu Gao, and I'm working on a project on attributed LLMs. 
- I'm also currently writing my undergraduate thesis on open-domain question answering.
- Feel free to visite my [website](https://howard-yen.github.io/), where you can find a copy of my resume!
