### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Howard Yen, a 2nd year student studying Computer Science at Princeton University. 

Here's a little bit about me: 
- Iâ€™m currently classes in Natural Language Processing, Advanced Programming Techniques, Economics and Computing, and Probability and Stochastic Systems.
- Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and React JS, but also improving my C++ skills through leetcode. 
- I'm currently working on making my own [website](https://howard-yen.github.io/)!
