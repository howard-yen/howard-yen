### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Howard Yen, a sophomore studying Computer Science at Princeton University. 

Here's a little bit about me: 
- Iâ€™m currently in the middle of my sophomore where I'm taking classes in Operating Systems, Fucntional Programming, and Computer Vision.
- Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and React JS, but also improving my C++ skills through practice on leetcode. 
- I'm currently working on making my own [website](https://howard-yen.github.io/)!
