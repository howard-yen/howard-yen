### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Howard Yen, a sophomore studying Computer Science at Princeton University. 

Here's a little bit about me: 
- Iâ€™m currently interning at [Map My Customers](https://mapmycustomers.me/). 
- Iâ€™m currently learning PostgreSQL and I'm planning on learning JavaScript soon. 
- I'm currently working on a MangaDex scrapper to automatically send chapters to Kindle as pdf files (can't make it public but message me if you want to talk about it!)
